                I have experience in several languages through Red river and their coding projects such as a C# banking application that focused on learning design patterns such as singleton and the observer pattern. <br/>
                Experience with PHP scripting for login authentication ensuring properly encrypted passwords and sanitization to mitigate SQL injection attacks.
                Experience with Ruby on Rails web framework building a full stack E-commerce website using PostgresSQL<br/>
                I believe some of the best ways to learn is by doing. I haved decided to teach myself React and the more I learn the more I discover. Every time I learn discover more tools and ideas to use!

I have always been someone who will try to learn something by themselves through trial and error. At the age of 15 I started to learn how to play guitar to get girls . . . well that didnâ€™t work but I still play guitar to this day and have been recently learning more about musical theory to understand why the things I play work. Another one of my big passions is cooking. I
