                        I believe some of the best ways to learn is by doing. I haved decided to teach myself React and the more I learn the more I discover. Every time I learn discover more tools and ideas to use!

                        I am a 24 year old BIT graduate born I have tons of hobbies that I love! One of my biggest interests would have to be music. I have always been someone who will try to learn something by themselves through trial and error. At the age of 15 I started to learn how to play guitar to get girls . . . well that didnâ€™t work but I still play guitar to this day and have been recently learning more about musical theory to understand why the things I play work. I am always up to the challenge of learning new things
